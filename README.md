# SQL-Project-for-DVD-Rental
This is a project working on different SQL techniques from the basic level to the advanced level. In this practice, I used Postgresql to process the DVD rental database. The database is a sample database that consists of 15 tables, 1 trigger, 7 views, 8 functions, 1 domain, and 13 sequences. Below is a simplified graph of the relational tables which illustrate relationships and variables contained.

There are three questions answered in this practice:
1. Top 10 most rented film titles
2. The profits of films by categories and ratings
3. Top 10 payment customers' information

The techniques involved in this project are but are not limited to where clause, join, window function, concatenation, aggregation function, group by, order by, and sub-query.
